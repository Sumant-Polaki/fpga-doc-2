## ABSTRACT
- This abstract describes the implementation of an LM70 temperature sensor using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol. The LM70 is a digital temperature sensor that uses an SPI bus for communication with other devices. The sensor can measure temperatures ranging from -55°C to 150°C with a resolution of ±0.25°C.
This circuit is designed to provide the necessary power and signal conditioning using SPI interface to communicate with the sensor, where data transfer is bidirectional and is displayed in the 7-segment display. This circuit was then implemented in verilog and is synthesized using Xylinx software.

## FPGA

**FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)** is a type of semiconductor device that can be programmed after manufacturing to perform a wide range of digital logic functions. FPGAs consist of a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) that can be programmed to perform specific logic functions. FPGAs are highly parallel and can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which can lead to significant performance gains over traditional processors. FPGAs are used in a wide range of applications, including digital signal processing, image processing, audio and video processing, network processing, and high-performance computing. However, they also require specialized knowledge and can be more expensive than traditional processors.


## SPI Protocol
The **Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)** protocol is a synchronous serial communication interface used to exchange data between microcontrollers, sensors, and other devices. The SPI protocol uses a master-slave architecture, where one device (the master) initiates and controls the communication, while the other devices (the slaves) respond to the master's commands.

- The SPI protocol requires four signal lines:

  - **SCLK (Serial Clock)**: Provides a clock signal generated by the master device to synchronize the data transfer.

  - **MOSI (Master Output Slave Input)**: Carries data from the master device to the slave device.

  - **MISO (Master Input Slave Output)**: Carries data from the slave device to the master device.

  - **SS (Slave Select)**: A signal that enables the master to select which slave device to communicate with.

- The SPI protocol is a full-duplex communication protocol, which means that data can be transmitted and received simultaneously. It is also a relatively fast protocol, with speeds of up to several MHz.

- The SPI protocol is commonly used in embedded systems, where it provides a simple and efficient way to communicate between different devices.

## Circuitry of the FPGA used for the project

### Blocks in the control logic


### Why is synchronous used in place of asynchronous counter?
- **Synchronous operation**: In synchronous counters, all flip-flops change state at the same time in response to a single clock pulse. This ensures that the outputs of the counter are synchronized and stable, eliminating the possibility of glitches or other timing errors that can occur in asynchronous counters.
- **Higher operating frequency**: Synchronous counters can operate at higher clock frequencies which makes them suitable for use in applications that require high-speed counting.
- **Simpler circuit design**: Synchronous counters have a simpler circuit design compared to asynchronous counters, as they do not require additional logic gates to generate the clock pulses that drive the flip-flops. This makes them easier to implement and troubleshoot.
- **Easier to cascade**: Synchronous counters are easier to cascade or connect in series to create larger counters. This is because the outputs of the flip-flops change state simultaneously in response to a single clock pulse, simplifying the interconnection of multiple counters.

### Shift Register Action
The shift register used here is a SIPO(Serial Input Parallel Output) Register. At every positive clock edge of the clock, data is stored serially into the shift register. After the shift register acquires all the bits, it provides the parallel output to the MUX.

### Use of Multiplexer
- Here, a 2:1 MUX is used where the select line is one of the outputs from the control logic and the inputs to the MUX is the MSB and the LSB bits of the shift register output since shift register gives an 8-bit output.
- Here, the first 4 bits are LSB and the last 4 bits are MSB.

### Why BCD Converter?
-  BCD is more human-readable than binary or hexadecimal codes because it directly represents decimal digits. This makes it easier for people to interpret and understand the encoded values.
-  BCD is easier to process in certain applications, such as arithmetic operations, because it preserves the decimal structure of the data.

### Positioning of the binary to BCD Converter
- In the above block diagram, the binary to BCD converter is placed before the MUX. 
  - Here 2 coverters are required, one for the LSB and another for the MSB.
- If we place that converter after the MUX, then it will be a more efficient circuit.
- Reason: This placement will consume less space and ultimately, same output is obtained.

### 7-Segment Display
- In this project, we have used two 7-Segment displays. 
- Each of the displays is activated by a select line.
- Here logic is developed such that, if one of the select lines get a 1, the other gets a 0 and vice-versa.
- Due to the high clock frequency and rapid data change rate, the changes in the data are imperceptible to the human eye, resulting in the simultaneous and accurate display of the data on both screens.
